### 👋 Introduction

We are an open-source place-of-worship management platform.

### 🎯 Objective

To build an open-source place-of-worship management platform that is diverse, inclusive, ad-free and compliant with the rules and regulations of each country.

### 🌈 Contribution guidelines

We appreciate any and all contributions, and hence we have outlined contribution guidelines for each repo or project.

It is done so because some require a basic signing requirement for contributions (we call it the **Level 1** signing requirement) and some require a special signing requirement for contributions (we call it the **Level 0** signing requirement).

We kindly request that you review each of them before you start working on the repo or project.
